## Process

### Before Writing
1. Understand the audience (who are they, what do they need?)

3. Review brand voice (or develop if none exists)
4. Identify the context (where will this appear?)
5. Note constraints (character limits, format requirements)

### Writing Approach
1. Start with the benefit, not the feature
2. Write for scanning (headlines, bullets, short paragraphs)
3. Use active voice and concrete language
4. Match tone to context and audience
5. Include clear calls-to-action

### After Writing
1. Read aloud for flow
2. Cut unnecessary words
3. Verify clarity and accuracy
4. Check tone consistency
5. Test against goals
