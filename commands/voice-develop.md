# Brand Voice Development Command

Guided process to develop brand voice guidelines from scratch.

## Usage
```
/project:voice-develop [brand-name]
```

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Discovery
Copy-specialist asks discovery questions:

1. **Brand Basics**
   - What does [brand] do?
   - Who is your target audience?
   - What problem do you solve?

2. **Personality**
   - If your brand were a person, how would you describe them?
   - What 3 adjectives should people associate with your brand?
   - What adjectives should they NOT associate?

3. **Comparison**
   - Name 2-3 brands whose voice you admire (any industry)
   - Name 2-3 brands you don't want to sound like
   - Where do you fall: formal ↔ casual, serious ↔ playful?

4. **Existing Materials**
   - Do you have any existing copy I can review?
   - Any previous brand guidelines?
   - Any customer feedback about your communication?

### Phase 2: Attribute Definition
Based on discovery, copy-specialist:

1. Proposes 3-5 voice attributes
2. Defines each attribute with:
   - What it means
   - What it looks like
   - What it doesn't mean
3. Gets feedback and refines

### Phase 3: Tone Mapping
Copy-specialist creates tone guidance:

1. Maps tone across contexts (marketing, support, errors, etc.)
2. Creates do's and don'ts
3. Develops word lists (prefer/avoid)

### Phase 4: Examples
Copy-specialist provides:

1. Before/after examples
2. Sample copy in the new voice
3. Channel-specific examples
