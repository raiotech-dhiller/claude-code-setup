## Quick Voice Definition

If you can't do a full workshop, answer these questions:

```
1. We are: (3 attributes)
   _________, _________, _________

2. We're not:
   _________, _________, _________

3. Our voice sounds like:

   _________________________________
```

This gives you enough to start writing consistently.

## Voice Statement Template

```
[Brand] is [attribute 1], [attribute 2], and [attribute 3].

We talk to our customers like [relationship analogy—e.g., "a knowledgeable friend," "a trusted advisor," "a helpful colleague"].

Our tone is [general tone], but we flex to be more [tone A] when [context] and more [tone B] when [context].

We always [do thing]. We never [avoid thing].

If [Brand] were a person, they'd be [description].
```

### Example
```
Basecamp is direct, casual, and confident.

We talk to our customers like a smart friend who's been through the same struggles.

Our tone is conversational and friendly, but we flex to be more serious when discussing data/security and more celebratory when customers hit milestones.

We always use plain language and get to the point. We never use jargon or corporate-speak.

If Basecamp were a person, they'd be the coworker who tells it like it is, shares what actually works, and doesn't waste your time.
```
