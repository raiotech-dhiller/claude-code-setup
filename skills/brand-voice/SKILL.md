## Voice vs Tone

### Voice (Consistent)
- Personality that doesn't change
- Who you are
- Your brand's character traits
- Consistent across all channels

### Tone (Varies)
- How you express your voice
- Adapts to situation and audience
- Ranges from serious to playful
- Changes based on context

### Example
```
Voice: Confident, friendly, expert
Tone varies:

Marketing: Energetic, inspiring
→ "Transform the way you work"

Error message: Calm, helpful
→ "That didn't work. Let's try again."

Legal: Clear, professional
→ "Your data is protected under our Terms of Service."
```

## Voice Attributes

### Defining Voice
Choose 3-5 attributes that describe your brand's personality.

### Common Voice Attributes
```
Friendly        Professional      Bold
Warm           Authoritative     Direct
Conversational  Expert           Confident
Playful         Trustworthy      Innovative
Witty           Reliable         Empowering
Casual          Sophisticated    Approachable
Human           Premium          Down-to-earth
```

### Attribute Framework
For each attribute, define:
```
[Attribute]

What it means:
[Definition in your context]

What it looks like:
[Concrete examples]

What it doesn't mean:
[Common misinterpretations]
```

### Example
```
Friendly

What it means:
We talk like a helpful colleague, not a corporation.
We're approachable and make people feel welcome.

What it looks like:
- Contractions (we're, you'll, it's)
- First and second person (we, you)
- Conversational phrases ("Here's the thing...")
- Emoji where appropriate

What it doesn't mean:
- Overly casual or slangy
- Unprofessional or silly
- Ignoring context (error messages should still be calm)
```

## Tone Spectrum

### Mapping Tone to Context

## Testing Voice

### Voice Checklist
- [ ] Does it sound like our brand?
- [ ] Would we say this out loud?
- [ ] Is the tone right for the context?
- [ ] Is it clear and easy to understand?
- [ ] Does it avoid jargon?
- [ ] Is it consistent with other copy?

### The "Person" Test
```
If our brand were a person:
- How would they greet someone?
- How would they deliver bad news?
- How would they celebrate good news?
- What words would they never use?
```

### Read It Aloud
If it sounds awkward when spoken, rewrite it.
