4. Allow skipping (when possible)
5. Set expectations

   [Allow notifications] [Not now]"
```

### Permission Copy Patterns
```
For notifications:
"Get notified when [specific value].
You can change this anytime in Settings."

For location:
"Allow location to [specific benefit].
We only use this when you [context]."

For contacts:
"Find friends on [Product] by allowing access to your contacts.
We'll never contact them without your permission."
```

## Form/Input Screens

### Progressive Disclosure
Only ask for what's needed now.

```
Screen 1: "What should we call you?" [Name]
Screen 2: "What brings you here?" [Use case selector]
Screen 3: "Invite your team (optional)" [Email inputs]
```

### Input Guidance
