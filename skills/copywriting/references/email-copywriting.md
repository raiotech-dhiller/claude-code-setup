```

**Social Proof:**

```

### Subject Line Best Practices

### Patterns
```

Preview: I noticed something that might help...

Subject: [Number]% off ends tonight
Preview: Plus a bonus I haven't mentioned yet.

Subject: The real reason projects fail
Preview: It's not what you think (and it's fixable).

```
